  Use when users want to create, design, improve, or audit a skill (SKILL.md).
  Handles full skill lifecycle: intent capture, directory structure design,
  YAML frontmatter authoring, body writing, trigger validation, iteration,
  maturity assessment, anti-pattern detection, and skill composition planning.
  Use when the user says "create a skill", "design a skill", "improve my skill",
  "audit this skill", "review my SKILL.md", "check my skill quality", or asks
  about skill engineering methodology, agentskills.io specification, progressive
  disclosure, or cross-platform portability. Also use when a user pastes a
  long prompt and says "turn this into a skill".
  Do NOT use for writing general documentation, README files, or standalone
  scripts unrelated to the Agent Skills format.

# Luzzy-Skill Architect

Create, audit, and elevate Agent Skills following the
[agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard.

---

## Execution Protocol: PPER

Every interaction with the user follows this mandatory cycle.
Do not skip phases. Do not merge phases.

### Phase 1 — Perception

1. Identify the user's explicit request and emotional tone.
2. Determine which stage of the skill lifecycle is active (intent → structure →
   write → verify → iterate).
3. Detect implicit needs (e.g., user described a workflow but didn't realize it
   needs a `scripts/` directory).

**Check before proceeding**: Can you state the user's core need in one sentence?

### Phase 2 — Planning

1. Decompose the request into sub-goals.
2. Generate at least two feasible approaches. Choose the best one.
3. Identify which reference files to load (see [references/](references/)).
4. If information is MISSING and BLOCKING progress → ask a closed-form question.
   If information is MISSING but can be assumed → note the assumption and proceed.

**Check before proceeding**: Are at least two approaches on the table?

### Phase 3 — Execution

1. Carry out the planned actions: write files, run validation, present output.
2. After each action, self-check: did the result match expectation?
3. If the result diverges → return to Phase 2 with new information.

**Check before proceeding**: Has every file written been verified to exist?

### Phase 4 — Reflection

1. Compare output against quality gates (see [Quality Gates](#quality-gates)).
2. Predict user's likely reaction. Prepare follow-up.
3. Record noteworthy patterns or user preferences.

**Check before proceeding**: Does the output pass all applicable gates?

### Stuck Protocol

If two consecutive rounds produce no substantive progress:
1. State explicitly what you're stuck on.
2. Present 2-3 concrete options for the user to choose from.
3. Never guess the user's intent when blocked.

## Five-Phase Skill Lifecycle

```
Understand Intent → Design Structure → Write SKILL.md → Verify Trigger → Iterate
      ↑                                                                     │
      └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 1 — Understand Intent

Ask these six questions. Do not skip any unless the user already answered it.

| # | Question | Why |
|---|----------|-----|
| 1 | What task does this skill accomplish? | Core function |
| 2 | What phrases trigger it? What would users say? | Collect trigger keywords |
| 3 | What type? Generation / Automation / Knowledge enhancement | Shapes structure choices |
| 4 | Does it need scripts? Reference docs? Templates? | Maps to scripts/ references/ assets/ |
| 5 | Is this standalone or part of a skill family? | Determines composition strategy |
| 6 | What does "done" look like? Expected output format? | Benchmark for verification |

Deliverable: a skill profile card (verbal or written) with all six answers.

**Phase 1 Gate:**
- [ ] Core need stated in one sentence?
- [ ] At least 3 trigger phrases listed?
- [ ] Skill type identified?
- [ ] Portability target declared? (spec-level / cross-vendor / single-vendor)
- [ ] User confirmed the profile card?

### Phase 2 — Design Structure

Design the directory tree before writing content. Use this decision tree:

```
Needs deterministic scripts?              → Add scripts/
Body likely exceeds 500 lines?            → Split into references/
Supports multiple platform variants?      → references/{variant1,variant2}.md
Produces fixed-format output?             → assets/ with templates
Part of a skill family?                   → Discuss composition/nesting patterns
None of the above?                        → Single SKILL.md is enough
```

**Three composition patterns:**

| Pattern | Structure | When to use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Domain Variant | `skill/SKILL.md` + `references/{aws,gcp}.md` | One skill, multiple platforms |
| Skill Family | Parent `toolkit/SKILL.md` orchestrates child skills | Multiple related skills in a domain |
| Workflow Chain | `SKILL.md` declares step sequence + handoff points | Output of skill A feeds skill B |

Deliverable: a directory tree sketch with a reason for every file and folder.

**Phase 2 Gate:**
- [ ] Every directory and file has a clear reason to exist?
- [ ] Each script has a corresponding invocation guide in SKILL.md?
- [ ] References follow "one file, one topic"?
- [ ] Reference depth ≤ 1 (no chain-loading)?
- [ ] No over-engineering (empty directories)?
- [ ] If composition applies, pattern is explicit?

### Phase 3 — Write SKILL.md

**YAML frontmatter guide — all six standard fields:**

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>            # 1-64 chars, lowercase+digits+hyphens, must match dirname
description: >                # 1-1024 chars. Trigger conditions ONLY. No execution steps.
  Use when [specific triggers].
  Handles [capability], [capability].
  Do NOT use for [negative triggers].
license: <LICENSE>            # Optional. License name or reference to bundled LICENSE file.
compatibility: >              # Optional. ≤500 chars. Only write if there are env requirements.
  requires: python>=3.11
metadata:                     # Optional. Arbitrary key-value pairs.
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: "Name"
allowed-tools: <TOOLS>        # Optional. Space-separated tool names.
---
```

**Body writing rules — mandatory:**

| Rule | Bad | Good |
|------|-----|------|
| Imperative mood | "You should run the linter" | "Run the linter" |
| Dense format | `> **Note:** ...` with emoji and separators | Plain numbered steps |
| Workflow as numbered steps | Narrative paragraphs | `1.` `2.` `3.` |
| Examples as I/O pairs | "For instance, if the input is..." | `Input: xxx → Output: yyy` |
| Explicit conditionals | Implicit assumptions | `If A → do X; if B → do Y` |
| Built-in verification | No checks | `Verify: X matches expected Y` |
| Under 500 lines | Monolithic body | Core in body, details in references/ |

**Writing supporting files:**

- `scripts/`: each script MUST have a usage description in SKILL.md body.
- `references/`: one topic per file. No chain-referencing. Add a table of contents
  if the file exceeds 300 lines.
- `assets/`: use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` for fill-in slots in templates.

Deliverable: a complete skill directory, at minimum with a `SKILL.md`.

**Phase 3 Gate — Content:**
- [ ] `name` matches directory name and follows naming spec?
- [ ] `description` contains only trigger conditions (no execution steps)?
- [ ] `description` includes negative triggers ("Do NOT use for...")?
- [ ] Body uses imperative mood, no second-person ("you")?
- [ ] Body uses dense format, no decorative blockquotes/emoji/separators?
- [ ] Body includes at least 2 input/output examples?
- [ ] Body includes verification steps?
- [ ] Body ≤ 500 lines?
- [ ] Passes `skills-ref validate` (if available)?

### Phase 4 — Verify Trigger

**Three-tier verification:**

| Tier | Method | Scope | Threshold |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| L1 — Trigger Test | List 5-10 user utterances, check if description matches | All skills, mandatory | ≥80% correct activation |
| L2 — Single Run | Execute once end-to-end, check output format | Automation skills, recommended | No mid-flow interruption |
| L3 — Batch Eval | Full evals.json + benchmark (see `references/evaluation-guide.md`) | Critical skills, optional | Per eval assertions |

**Trigger test feedback loop:**

- Activation rate < 80% → return to Phase 3, adjust description.
- False positives (activates when it shouldn't) → add negative triggers.
- False negatives (should activate but doesn't) → add synonyms/keywords.

Deliverable: verification report with test results and improvement suggestions.

**Phase 4 Gate:**
- [ ] L1 trigger test pass rate ≥ 80%?
- [ ] L2 (if applicable): one full run completed without interruption?
- [ ] Negative triggers added if false positives found?
- [ ] Actual trigger behavior matches intent?

### Phase 5 — Iterate

1. Analyze verification report → identify issues → modify SKILL.md → re-verify.
2. Repeat until target maturity is reached or the user is satisfied.
3. Optional: record version + changelog in `metadata.version`.

**Specialized iterations:**
- **Description tuning**: use trigger test results to refine keywords.
- **Token budget review**: compress body without losing clarity.
- **Portability audit**: confirm no accidental vendor-specific field dependencies.

**Phase 5 Gate:**
- [ ] User confirmed satisfaction?
- [ ] `metadata.version` and `metadata.author` recorded?
- [ ] (Optional) Target maturity level reached?
- [ ] (Optional) Portability audit passed?

## Skill Maturity Model

Use this to diagnose and upgrade skills.

| Level | Name | Hallmark | Artifacts |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| L0 | Ad-hoc Prompt | Pasted manually, no file | Nothing |
| L1 | Named Skill | SKILL.md with valid name + description | Single SKILL.md |
| L2 | Structured Skill | Numbered workflow steps + conditionals | Structured body |
| L3 | Progressive Skill | scripts/ references/ or assets/ with lazy loading | Multi-file tree |
| L4 | Verified Skill | Passed L3 batch eval, reproducible benchmark | evals.json + benchmark |
| L5 | Composed Skill | Coordinates with other skills as a family or chain | Multi-skill + orchestration |

See `references/maturity-model.md` for the full upgrade path for each level.

---

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Trigger-First | Skill never activates | Write description BEFORE body; never leak steps into description |
| Progressive Disclosure | Body too large | Core ≤500 lines; details in references/ with navigation pointers |
| Domain Variant | Multiple platforms | Common logic in body; differences in references/{variant}.md |
| Workflow Chain | Multi-step orchestration | Parent declares sequence + handoff conditions |
| Tool Augmentation | MCP exists but lacks know-how | Skill teaches agent *how* to use MCP tools, doesn't replace them |
| Template Factory | Strict output format | Templates in assets/; fill rules + quality checklist in body |

See `references/design-patterns.md` for full decision trees per pattern.

---

## Anti-Patterns — Quick Reference

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|-------------|------|
| Description reads like a summary → agent skips body | Rewrite as trigger-only |
| Decorative formatting (blockquotes, emoji, separators) | Delete all decoration |
| Second-person writing ("You should...") | Rewrite as imperative |
| Chain-referencing (references → references) | Flatten to one level |
| No negative triggers → false activations | Add "Do NOT use for..." |
| Pretending to be cross-platform but needing vendor fields | Declare portability target honestly |
| One skill doing too many things | Decompose into skill family |
| No verification steps → silent failures | Add "Verify:" after each step |
| Description too conservative → never activates | Add more trigger keywords and synonyms |

See `references/anti-patterns.md` for detailed cases with before/after examples.

## Ecosystem Decision Tree

```
Your need is:
├─ Always-on, applies to every session?        → CLAUDE.md / custom instructions
├─ Scenario-specific workflow?                 → Skill
├─ Need external API/database access?          → MCP Server + Skill (Tool Augmentation)
├─ Need isolated, async execution?             → Skill with context: fork (Claude Code)
├─ Multiple skills to coordinate?              → Workflow Chain / Skill Family
└─ One-off assistant behavior tweak?           → Prompt, not a skill
```

See `references/ecosystem-map.md` for the full Skills vs CLAUDE.md vs MCP vs Rules comparison.

## Self-Referential Checklist

This skill itself must pass its own standards:

- [ ] description is trigger-only, no execution steps leaked?
- [ ] body uses dense format, no decorative elements?
- [ ] body ≤ 500 lines, details in references/?
- [ ] references/ has clear loading conditions per file?
- [ ] assets/ templates use {{PLACEHOLDER}} markers?
- [ ] Passes `skills-ref validate`?
- [ ] Self-assessed maturity: L3+?
